# We check only your final answer to the downloaded dataset in the box below, not your code itself. If you would like to provide your code as well, you may use the upload tool. Please also note that the correct answer to this problem will not in general be 34; it is simply an example of what you should return in the specific case that the legs of the triangle have length 3 and 5.


from math import*
num1 = input("Please enter a positive integer less than 1000: ")
num2 = input("Please enter another positive integer less than 1000: ")
result = float((pow(int(num1),2) + pow(int(num2),2)))

print(result)
